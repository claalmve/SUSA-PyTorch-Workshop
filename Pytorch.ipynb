    "PyTorch is a library made for the Python programming language as a platform on which to develop deep learning projects and applications. Released in Januuary 2016, it has gained fame for being able to create neural networks with relative ease. Before diving directly into PyTorch, it's important to understand the definition of a deep learning platform, deep learning, neural networks, and how they're connected. In a general sense, Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning, which is a subset of the large sphere of Artifical Intelligence."

    "    * Uses statements to continuously change the program's state\n",
    "    * Does not require for frameworks of code to be developed before being execute; executes on the fly\n",
    "* **Dynamic Computation Graph**\n",
    "    * Defined and manipulated as you code, as compared to static, where you define the graph before you run the model\n",
    "    * Really useful with dynamic inputs- static graphs can only have static input sequences!\n",
    "        * For RNNs, it's incredibly useful to have a dynamic computation graph, as inputs might change in structure over time (we'll get into more of RNNs later and why this is useful!)\n",
    "* **Declarative Data Parallelism**\n",
    "    * Easy to call torch.nn.DataParallel to wrap different modules and split samples into subsets to run computation for these subsets in parallel (provides for better efficiency and speed, and minimal effort to set up)"

    "Before we can get into any of the coding, we'll need to define what a tensor is in its relation to Deep Learning and coding!\n",
    "\n",
    "To define it generally, a tensor is a basically just an $n$ dimensional object (scalar, vector, matrix). What this means is that a rank 0 tensor can be represented with a 0-dimensional object (a scalar), a rank 1 tensor can be represented with a 1-dimensional object (vector), and a rank 2 tensor can be represented with a 2-dimensional object (matrix). **However, this does not mean that these objects can be represented as tensors!** Tensors have special properties that make them useful in Deep Learning, one being that they're flexible in structure and can take on any arbitrary rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another implication with tensors that make them more useful than just vectors or matrices in Deep Learning models are how they can be **variable with relation to the other entities around them**. For example, if you wanted a model to maintain consistent weights despite the fact that different inputs may be transformed, tensors would be able to be replaced with the scalar weights to be able to sustain different transformations while not impacting the outputs!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, these definitions/usages for tensors may be confusing, but we just wanted to give you a brief glimpse into why it's more useful than just using objects with static dimensions. For the purposes of this notebook, it'll be sufficient to just interpret tensors as \"arrays\", but just know that there are key differences between the two. If you're interested in learning more about the differences between the two, click [here](https://medium.com/@quantumsteinke/whats-the-difference-between-a-matrix-and-a-tensor-4505fbdc576c) to learn more!"

Data loaders are different tools/pieces of code that enable us to be able to load our data into our model without having to run the computation on all our data points all at once (saving memory and computational load). Data loaders are also not something specific to PyTorch, but the reason why we introduce them today is because data loaders are incredibly intuitive and efficient to use with PyTorch's implementation!\n",
